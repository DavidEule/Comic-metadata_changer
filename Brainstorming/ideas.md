# Features i want to implement (high priority)
    -import metadata into script via button on toolbar
        -cant be done with multiple files, you have to select a single one
        -it has to have a messagebox telling the user what kind of retard they are if they dare to select multiple files at once

    -make it so it gives you an actual notification using the wodnwos notification api thingimagic when the writing process is done
    
    -finally fix it so that you can adjust the size of the file window compared to the window showing you the metadata in those fields

    -possibly make it so that you are able to see all the metadata in the programm in addition to also be able to import it into the fields
        -make a seperate window which shows you the metadata of the book seperate from the fields

# Costetic changes I intend to do later
    -make tkinter have a less ugly icon
        -maybe use windows iconset for something book-ish
