# Features i want to implement
    -since i already implimented an auto numbering system for volumes, i would now like to implement the following system that works like that
        -variables that do the same thing
            -lets say i have Volume 1  and Volume 2, yet its part of the name of the book... so i write into the title field something like "Bookname - Volume %n%" in which case it puts the appropriate number into the title, corosponding to the position of the file
             "Book 2 - Volume %n%" position 1 so %n% gets replaced with 1 in this case
             "Book 13 - Volume %n%" position 2 so %n% gets replaced with 2 in this case

# Cosmetic changes I intend to do later
    -make tkinter have a less ugly icon
        -maybe use windows iconset for something book-ish
